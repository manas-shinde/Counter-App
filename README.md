## Concepts Covered

### Setting Attributes

The application demonstrates the concept of setting attributes in React components. It includes an example where the className attribute of an element is updated dynamically based on a condition.

### Rendering Classes Dynamically

The application showcases dynamic class rendering in React components. The CSS classes applied to elements are determined based on specific conditions or component states.

### Passing Event Arguments

The application illustrates the technique of passing event arguments in React. It shows an example where a function is called with an argument when an event occurs.

### Passing Value to Child Component

The application demonstrates the process of passing values from a parent component to a child component in React. It includes an example where a parent component passes a value as a prop to its child component.

### Control Component without Local State

The application includes a control component that does not have local state. It receives values and functions as props from its parent component and triggers actions based on user interactions.

### Contributing

If you find any issues with the application or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request in the GitHub repository. Contributions are always welcome!

### Stateless Functional Component

The Counter App includes a stateless functional component called Navbar. This component serves as a control element and does not have its own local state. It receives values and functions as props from its parent component, allowing it to interact with the counter.
